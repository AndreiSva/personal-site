This is a simple project I made back in 2019 to learn javascript and experiment with front end development. It works but it's definetly not perfect and it showcases a lot of common bad practices.

Binary Converter is a tool for converting text between binary and ascii made in javascript with the GUI made in HTML and CSS. It was built using the [materialize](https://materializecss.com/) css library which allowed for the nice material UI used in the demo.
