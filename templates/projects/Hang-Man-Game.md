Hang Man is a game where players take turns guessing letters in order to fill the missing letters from a selected word. If the player is wrong, a random limb dissapears from the hang man. The goal is to complete all missing letters from the word before every limb of the hang man is removed.

This implementation of the hang man game I made in 2019 is complete with over 20 different words to guess, music, and graphics. 


## running
if you want to try out my Hang Man game you'll need to have a version of python3 installed as well as the pygame library. Then simply clone the repository, run HangMan.py, and you are good to go!
